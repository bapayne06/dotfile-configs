-- This is an organized repository for my dotfile configurations on linux --

-- The configurations are also held in a git repository for further 
editing --

-- The main dotfiles are held in their respective directories, while 
symlinked copies of themselves are held in the user home directory
for the programs to access. This is done with GNU Stow --
