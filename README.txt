This is a repository dedicated to holding all my configuration files
for my Linux Mint PC.

Files and directories are categorized based on the application/program they
are used for, all that needs to be done to enable them is using GNU Stow in
the terminal on each directory inside /.dotfiles to create the needed symlinks
in the user home directory.
